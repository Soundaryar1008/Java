# Basic Java Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs, serving as a starting point for learning Java or as a quick reference for common programming concepts.  These examples cover fundamental elements of the Java language and provide practical demonstrations of their usage.

## Contents

The repository is organized into individual Java files, each demonstrating a specific concept or technique.  Here's a brief overview of the programs included:

*   **`HelloWorld.java`**: The classic "Hello, World!" program, demonstrating basic output and program structure.
*   **`VariablesAndDataTypes.java`**: Examples of declaring and using different data types (int, double, boolean, String, etc.) in Java.
*   **`Operators.java`**: Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
*   **`ControlFlow.java`**: Examples of `if-else` statements, `switch` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops for controlling program execution.
*   **`Arrays.java`**: Shows how to work with arrays in Java, including declaration, initialization, and accessing elements.
*   **`Methods.java`**: Examples of defining and calling methods, including passing arguments and returning values.
*   **`ClassesAndObjects.java`**: Introduction to object-oriented programming with classes and objects, including creating objects and using their methods.
*   **`InputOutput.java`**: Demonstrates how to read input from the user using `Scanner` and write output to the console.
*   **`ExceptionHandling.java`**: Basic examples of using `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions.
*   **`Fibonacci.java`**:  Calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
*   **`Factorial.java`**: Computes the factorial of a given integer.
*   **`PrimeNumber.java`**: Checks if a given number is prime.
*   **`Palindrome.java`**: Checks if a given string or number is a palindrome.
*   **`ArmstrongNumber.java`**: Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number.
*   **`NumberGuessingGame.java`**: A simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
*   **`StringManipulation.java`**: Examples of common string manipulation techniques, like finding length, concatenation, substring extraction, etc.
*   **`SortingAlgorithms.java`**: Demonstrates basic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.
*   *(Add more descriptions as needed)*

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Compile the Java Files:**
    Navigate to the directory containing the Java files and compile them using the Java compiler (`javac`):
    ```bash
    javac *.java  // Compiles all .java files in the directory
    ```
    Or compile individual files:
    ```bash
    javac Fibonacci.java
    ```

3.  **Run the Programs:**
    After successful compilation, you can run the programs using the Java runtime environment (`java`):
    ```bash
    java Fibonacci  // Runs the Fibonacci program
    ```
    Replace `Fibonacci` with the name of the class you want to run.
